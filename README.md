Known issues
------------

### mojave:

- For mojave after reboot of the first upgrade, during the user loading we need to allow the system event pop-up for selenium.sh script

### catalina:

- For catalina after first upgrade we need to allow the Java pop-up, and as well to go to 'Security & Privacy' and to allow Java in the following 3 places - screen recording, full disk access, accessibility (same as doing in first installation via Install4j)

### mac:

- make sure the deployment user should have sudo permissions with 'NOPASSWD: ALL' privileges.

### windows:

- After windows updates sometimes winrm service get stopped and reset, To fix winrm reset issues, run [ansible-role-winrm-startup](https://github.com/ExperitestOfficial/ansible-role-winrm-startup) role on all windows machines once.
- currently its causing error with parallel windows selenium deployment, recommended to run one at a time or add "serial: 1" flag in playbook to deploy multiple selenium windows.
